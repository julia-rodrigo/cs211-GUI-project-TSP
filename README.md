# cs211-GUI-project-TSP

I used eclipse ide for this.

Create a new project 'CS211 PROJECT' and dont create module 

Add a package called 'TheActualThing' 

Save TSP.java file in 'TheActualThing' package and Name the public class 'TSP'

run the code and insert the data commented  at the start of the code into 'paste here' textarea

'add' into the table. You can keep adding as many data as you wish. only in the format taken otherwise rejected

You should be able to see how much time it takes to visit all the houses :) thank you for your time
